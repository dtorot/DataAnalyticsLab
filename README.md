- This example can be showed online using ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download)
- To run the app:
    - clone this repo in local, cd to the folder and run ```python dashExample.py```
    - previously must be installed the python dependencies:
        - ```pip install plotly```
        - ```pip install dash```
        - ```pip install pandas```
